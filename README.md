# Meditating Screens ðŸ§šðŸ’†
This is a small project built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No additional Libraries were used.

### The goal of this project
I just wanted to build some fancy animations with just CSS and JavaScript. The output now is a small tool, that lets you create meditating visualisations.
